In order to run your own instance, you will need to create a file in the config directory named `user_config.py` containing certain configuration variables:
- project_dir - the directory that the project is located in, this could almost definitely be detected programaticaly but i haven't found a way.
- token - the auth token for the (bot) account you want to connect to
